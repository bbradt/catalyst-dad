# Experiment Design

## Experiment Type 1: the role of rank and iterations in accuracy and communication

Batch size is fixed at 32, 
learning rate is fixed at 1e-4, 
number of epochs is fixed to 25, 
layer size is fixed
    [512,256,128,64,32,16] for feedforward
depth is fixed
    6 for feedforward
    4 + 2 for GRU, LSTM, ViT

We have 3 basic designs for this experiment:
    [RankCompare]. Rank 2,4,8,16,32 - pi fixed to 1, compare all methods
    [PiCompare]. Pi 1,2,4,8,32,64,128 - rank fixed to 2, rankdad only
    [PiRank]. Rank 2,4,8,16,32 and Pi 1,2,4,8,32,64,128 - only a few data sets due to complexity of search, rankdad only

We have 8 data sets / architectures:
    MNIST - FeedForward - Classification
    CIFAR - FeedForward - Classification
    CIFAR - ViT - Classification
    UEA - LSTM - Classification
    UEA - GRU - Classification
    ICA - LSTM - Classification
    ICA - GRU - Classification
    HCP - ViT - Segmentation
